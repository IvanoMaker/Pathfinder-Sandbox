- Standard Version -

the standard version is the version of update_field that redraws the entire field.
this includes pieces which will never change, such as walls.

this was the way the drawing loop worked.

    for (let n = 0; n < field.length; n++) {
            for (let m = 0; m < field[n].length; m++) {
                if (field[n][m].tick(field) == 1) {
                    updated.push([n, m]);
                }
            }
        }

running the 256x256 maze with cell size 2 and no additional time buffer took around 
43903.977294921875 ms or ~43.903 seconds to solve.

- Valid-Tile Version -

this version adds the valid_tiles array, which stores all the tiles which could change, as well as the start and end.
this prevents the draw loop from drawing tiles it never needs to, or looping unnecesarily.

the previous code in update_field was replaced with this.

    for (let n = 0; n < valid_tiles.length; n++) {
        if (field[valid_tiles[n][0]][valid_tiles[n][1]].tick(field) == 1) {
            updated.push([valid_tiles[n][0], valid_tiles[n][1]]);
        }
    }

running the 256x256 maze with cell size 2 and no additional time buffer took around
timer: 24670.54296875 ms or ~24.67 seconds to solve.
